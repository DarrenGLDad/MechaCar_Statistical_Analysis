<img width="522" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-08 at 11 19 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100239100/183556418-13500905-48f4-4791-bc68-ce0b5985bf35.png">

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  #### Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. (ground_clearance and vehicle_length had the most amount of random variance)

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  #### Examining the p-value, the slope is well below 0.3 and very weak...

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  #### The R-squared value is approximately 71%, which means 71% of the time the model will predict mpg values correctly.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Lot 1 and Lot 3 the PSI values are not different from the population mean. However lot 2 the p-value is .607 which means there is evidence that the suspension coil is different from the population mean. All t-tests can be seen below:
